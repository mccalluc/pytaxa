pytaxa modules
==============

`pytaxa` is split up into modules.

* constructors - functions to make a dict for a taxon name, rank, id or database
* Examples - examples to use to learn about using `pytaxa`
* taxa - Taxon, Taxa, Hierarchy, and Hierarchies classes

You can import the entire library, or each module individually as needed.
